QMWorks-NAMD
====================

One of the main problems to calculate (numerically) non-adiabatic coupling vectors (NACV) by standard quantum chemical (QM) packages is the computation of the overlap matrices between two states at two consecutive time-steps that are needed in the numerical differentiation to evaluate the coupling. This happens because  most of these softwares are inherently static, i.e. properties are computed for a given structural configuration, and the computation of the overlap matrices at different times requires complicated scripting tools to handle input/outputs of several QM packages. 

QMWorks-NAMD is a generic python library with the purpose of computing (numerically) NACVs using several quantum chemical (QM) packages. Its main advantage  is to use an internal module to compute efficiently the atomic overlap matrix at two consecutive time-steps by employing the same basis-set used in the electronic structure calculation. In this way QMWorks-NAMD lifts the "time" burden and the QM codes can be used to retrieve the molecular orbitals (MOs) coefficients computed at different time steps. This approach is very useful because the interface to a QM code then boils down to writing a simple module that reads the MOs coefficients in the specific code format. At this moment, QMWorks-NAMD handles output formats generated by CP2K, Orca, and Gamess, but, as said, it can be easily extended to other codes. 

QMWorks-NAMD has been designed to be an interface to Pyxaid, a python program that performs non-adiabatic molecular dynamic (NAMD) simulations using the classical path approximation (CPA), and it is there that it reaches its full potential. The CPA is based on the assumption that nuclear dynamics of the system remains unaffected by the dynamics of the electronic degrees of freedom. Hence, the electronic dynamics remains driven by the ground state nuclear dynamics. In this framework, QMWorks-NAMD requires as input the coordinates of a pre-computed trajectory  

but it can be straightforwardly adapted to any other NAMD code.

Additionally, QMWorks-NAMD can be used in benchmarks studies to test new code developments by providing a platform that uses all the functionalities of QMWorks.

Worflow to calculate Hamiltonians for nonadiabatic molecular simulations
************************************************************************
The figure represents schematically a Worflow to compute the **Hamiltonians** that described the behavior and coupling between the excited state of a molecular system. These **Hamiltonians** are used by thy PYXAID_ simulation package to carry out nonadiabatic molecular dynamics.
